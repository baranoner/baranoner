 Hi, I'm Baran Ã–ner. I'm currently learning computer science in Istanbul Bilgi University. This is my github account for school and hobby projects.
 I'm mostly interested in movies, games and playing drum. I'm playing drum since the beginning of high school. 
 In computer science I'm interested in mobile devolopment, data science and machine learning but It is early for me to decide which topic to focus on.
 I'm still very young and got so much to learn so If you can help me to learn more and get better, feel free to reach me.
 If you want to reach me:
